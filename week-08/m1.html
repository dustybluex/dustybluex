		<h2>I</h2>
		<section>
<p>I’m a very persistent, positive and creative person.</p>
        <p>As a child growing up in a fashion family in Beijing, China, I spontaneously
earned many opportunities to get closer to fashion when I was very young. My mother is
a fashion buyer, so I always traveled with her to foreign countries like Denmark and
other modern cities so that I got to know more about the production of clothes and
different texture and properties of fabrics. I knew that I was interested in fashion when I
was in elementary school.
</p>
            <p>Living in the boarding school since I was 3 years old extremely forced me to be
independent not only in life but also in my thinking. I like experiencing things because I
believe my own and true perception is most valuable; I like listening to different life
stories in person rather than reading books or through other indirect approaches. Once I
decide to do something, then no one is possible to change my mind. Constraint can not
be forced on me by anyone and anything, instead, I’m willing to follow my heart to do
my design. I have not choosing the mainstream from the time when I was very young.
